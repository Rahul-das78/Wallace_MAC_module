# Wallace_MAC_module
This Wallace MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) module takes two 16-bit inputs and performs multiplication using the Wallace tree reduction scheme. The resulting product is then accumulated with a 32-bit accumulator input. A final 33-bit output is produced after accumulation. A fast logarithmic adder, Brent-Kung Adder, is used for the final addition stage.
